# Introduction

Want to improve your working memory? Have no friends to play memory games with them? No problem, we have the technology to accomplish this task thanks to __PyWorkMem__.

WAIS IV, Stanford-Binet and several other IQ tests measure your working memory by making you repeating a list of numbers in order (or reverse order). This task was historically performed by collegiate psychopaths but now you can do it yourself with your computer.

PyWorkMem says in loud voice a series of numbers and/or letters and asks you to do some operation with them, for example ordering them or simply repeating the series. If you have a working microphone you can shout the hell out of the series to make your iq raise as high as your voice.
